Week 1
This week I used AI while working on the internship opportunities to help me broaden my knowledge of ones I can apply for. 
For instance, I asked about internships based in the dmv area. 
I further specified the type of internship I am looking for by asking follow up questions. 
Here is one of my AI chat links. https://chatgpt.com/share/68c71314-05d0-8002-9c52-c2c1a5c2ab6c

I did not get paired up with a team yet due to having to miss class for RA meeting however,
I did use chatgpt to help with project requierments. 

I also tried out Gemini AI this week but didnâ€™t have a good experience with it. 
I ran a comparison test using the same questions about internships in Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini, 
and they all gave me different results even with the same inputs. 
I used Claude to help me with ideas and learning, but I ended up liking the prompts for ChatGPT more.

Week 2 

This week I used AI for most of the same as last week, internships, and career work however I also did other things.
For one, I asked ChatGPT to give me some answers about a popular anime series "Bleach"
Me and my friend was having a debate about a place in the anime called soul society and the direct size of it

This allowed me to test the knowledge of the AI's memory

Week 3 

This week I used AI in a different manner than the other weeks. Classes have been picking up so I wanted to use it ot help with work
The first thing I asked chatgpt was for my Park Scholars class where I put the prompt in the AI and it gave me a draft for a response.
I then used it to check my code on R because my binomal test wasn't working and I needed to figure out how to solve the code.
It helped for the draft but it took a while for it to help me with the code. Here is a link to the chat. https://chatgpt.com/share/68d8990a-4188-8002-8795-efb23f50358c
