Week 1
This week I used AI while working on the internship opportunities to help me broaden my knowledge of ones I can apply for. 
For instance, I asked about internships based in the dmv area. 
I further specified the type of internship I am looking for by asking follow up questions. 
Here is one of my AI chat links. https://chatgpt.com/share/68c71314-05d0-8002-9c52-c2c1a5c2ab6c

I did not get paired up with a team yet due to having to miss class for RA meeting however,
I did use chatgpt to help with project requierments. 

I also tried out Gemini AI this week but didnâ€™t have a good experience with it. 
I ran a comparison test using the same questions about internships in Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini, 
and they all gave me different results even with the same inputs. 
I used Claude to help me with ideas and learning, but I ended up liking the prompts for ChatGPT more.

Week 2 

This week I used AI for most of the same as last week, internships, and career work however I also did other things.
For one, I asked ChatGPT to give me some answers about a popular anime series "Bleach"
Me and my friend was having a debate about a place in the anime called soul society and the direct size of it

This allowed me to test the knowledge of the AI's memory

Week 3 

This week I used AI in a different manner than the other weeks. Classes have been picking up so I wanted to use it ot help with work
The first thing I asked chatgpt was for my Park Scholars class where I put the prompt in the AI and it gave me a draft for a response.
I then used it to check my code on R because my binomal test wasn't working and I needed to figure out how to solve the code.
It helped for the draft but it took a while for it to help me with the code. Here is a link to the chat. https://chatgpt.com/share/68d8990a-4188-8002-8795-efb23f50358c 

Week 4

This week I used AI for debating. I said a quote that my friend disagreed with having any meaning. 
The quote was "what goes down the needle comes out the mouth". We started debating if it had any real meaning and I asked chatgpt what it meant.
Chatgpt then proved me right and then I won the debate with my friend. Here is the chatlog "https://chatgpt.com/share/68e2fdb4-604c-8013-ad85-221a997e1cc2"

Week 5

This week I used AI to help better my resume. I recently got accept into break through tech here @UMD and was conflcited on how to word it on my resume.
I asked AI to help me make some bullet points based on my existing resume and help me edit it. It helped greatly and gave me suggetions and insight on what I will do when it actually starts.
